# esphome-whirlpool-ac

Fork of standart [esphome/components/whirlpool](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/tree/28b5c535ec597571d836aeaf2c051a3c0b61b976/esphome/components/whirlpool) with additions:
* ~~add 1 sec mute pause for receiver just after ir transmitter send command to climate (this prevent component switching twice);~~
* ~~add support for optional binary sensor, that mute transmitter (it can help sync state of Home Assistant climate card with real climate state if they're out of sync);~~
* replace binary sensor with switch component, that on (by default) and off transmitter (it can help sync state of Home Assistant climate card with real climate state if they're out of sync);
* add support for iFeel mode (transmit to HVAc temperature from external source);

# Alert! New syntax of esphome yaml (see example.yaml)

```
#Add this to turn on transmitter on esp boot
